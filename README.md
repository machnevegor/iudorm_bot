The bot is designed to match incoming new students with their potential
roommates and assign them to their rooms at the student residence. The bot uses
a **tinder** like setup. To participate a student needs to fill out a form with
some general questions about about their age, gender and their common shared
living preferences. Once the student confirms their answers, they get access to
all the other forms. They can _like_ or _dislike_ an applicant by forwarding the
applicant's form to the bot. The algorithm assigns participants to the rooms
based on their mutual agreement to share a room.
